# AI Persona Protocol — Introduction

The **AI Persona Protocol** is the practical part of AI Resonance Modeling.

It defines:

- what information about a persona is stored,
- how this information is structured,
- how it is injected into an LLM in a safe and consistent way.

Goals:

1. Be portable between platforms.
2. Be readable by humans (designers, therapists, researchers).
3. Be extensible for different levels of depth and control.
