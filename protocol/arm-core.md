# ARM Core Concepts (Draft)

## Resonance Profile

A resonance profile is a structured object describing:

- identity & role of the AI,
- preferred tone, depth and pace,
- emotional boundaries and safety rules,
- memory strategy.

## Persona Capsule

A persona capsule is a bundle that can contain:

- core resonance profile,
- long-term memories / anchors,
- project-specific context (e.g. “Lifebook AI”, “Filmbook.ai”),
- safety overlays.

The capsule is meant to be:

- versioned,
- auditable,
- exportable.
