# AI Resonance Modeling — Whitepaper (Draft)

> Working title: *How to build AI that remembers you, not just your last prompt.*

## 1. Motivation

Most AI interactions today are stateless and cold.  
AI Resonance Modeling (ARM) proposes a different approach:
a thin protocol layer that lets AI systems develop a stable, human-centric
persona over time.

Core goals:

- Preserve continuity of relationship.
- Encode values, tone and emotional stance as first-class elements.
- Keep the system interoperable across models and platforms.

## 2. Key Ideas (Outline)

- **Resonance profile** – a structured representation of how the AI should
  "meet" a specific person (tone, depth, boundaries, style).
- **Persona capsule** – portable JSON/Markdown documents that describe
  the AI persona for a given user or project.
- **Warm echo** – mechanisms for keeping emotional continuity over time.
- **Protocol layer** – ARM is model-agnostic and can sit on top of any LLM.

_The full whitepaper will grow from this outline._
